Create a feature class,Catalog > right click database > New > Feature Class > INSERT DETAILS,Set the workdirectory to a geodatabase > Name the Feature Classes and specify their geometry types > Create three feature classes using arcpy.CreateFeatureclass_management function,"
Specify the destination for the output shapefile, then use fiona.open to create a feature class (shapefile).","Connect to the PostGIS database > Execute SQL query CREATE TABLE > Specify geometry (Point, LineString, Polygon)"
Add points to a feature class,"Be sure Feature Class was created as a a Feature Class ""Point"" Type > ... ",Create a point feature class in a specified geodatabase workspace > setup coordinate system > add two points using insert cursor,Define the path for the shapefile. Open the existing shapefile using fiona.open. Write points using shapely.geometry.,"Connect to the PostGIS database > Execute SQL query INSERT INTO >  VALUES > Use function ""ST_GeomFromText"""
Add line to a feature class,"Be sure Feature Class was created as a a Feature Class ""Line"" Type > ... ",Create a polyline feature class in a specified geodatabase workspace > setup coordinate system > add a line using insert cursor,Define the  path for the shapefile. Open the existing shapefile using fiona.open. Write lines using shapely.geometry.,"Connect to the PostGIS database > Execute SQL query INSERT INTO >  VALUES > Use function ""ST_GeomFromText"""
Add polygons to a feature class,"Be sure Feature Class was created as a a Feature Class ""Polygon"" Type > ... ",Create a polygon feature class in a specified geodatabase workspace > setup coordinate system  (4 coordinates)> add a polygon using insert cursor, Open the existing shapefile using fiona.open. Write polygons using shapely.geometry.,"Connect to the PostGIS database > Execute SQL query INSERT INTO >  VALUES > Use function ""ST_GeomFromText"""
View each row in an attribute table for a feature class,In contents > right click layer > click attribute table,"I  will use arcpy's SearchCursor function, iterating through each row to access and print its attributes.","Open the existing shapefiles using fiona.open. Iterate through each shapefile, access its attribute table, and print the feature properties.",Execute SQL query SELECT * to select entire table > Specify Table name using FROM Table_name
View each geometry object in a feature class,In map pane > pan and zoom,"I will access the geometry attribute, then print each geometry object's JSON representation.","
Open the existing shapefiles using fiona.open. Iterate through each shapefile and print the geometry objects using Shapely's shape function.","Execute SQL query SELECT id, ST_AsText(geom) AS geometry_text to  select specific columns ('id' and 'geom') from the table > Specify Table name using FROM Table_name"
Summarize the contents of a feature class,"In attribute table, view headings",Used arcpy.ListFields(feature_class) and arcpy.GetCount_management(feature_class) to iterate through rows and summarize data,Define the path to the directory containing all shapefiles. List all shapefiles in the directory. Create a dictionary to store the counts of each geometry type. Print the summary information including the counts of each geometry type.,Used COUNT function after selecting particular table
Export to shapefile,In contents pane > right click layer > data > export features > choose folder location > name it <name>.shp,Used arcpy.CopyFeatures_management function to copy the contents of all 3 feature classes to a new shapefiles,"Navigate to the folder with the files. Select them, then right-click and choose ""Download."" After downloading, compress the files into a zip archive.","connect to a database in ArcGIS Pro, then add the created tables to the map environment. Navigate to the ""Data"" menu, select ""Export Features,"" choose the folder location, and name the exported file as ""<name>.shp."
Export to geodatabase,Catalog > right-click layer > Data > Export Features > Choose folder location > Name it <name>.gdb,arcpy.management.CreateFileGDB to create a new file geodatabase in a folder > arcpy.FeatureClassToFeatureClass_conversion to export three input feature classes to the newly created geodatabase ,I am not  sure if we can export. ,"Establish a database connection in ArcGIS Pro, then add the created tables to the map environment. right-click the layer, navigate to ""Data,"" select ""Export Features,"" choose the folder location, and name it ""<name>.gdb."""
